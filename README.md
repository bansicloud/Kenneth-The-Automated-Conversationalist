# Kenneth, the Automated Conversationalist
Are you incredibly bored out of your mind? Are you interested in just casually chatting with someone, or making a new friend? 
If so, try meeting Kenneth, the Automated Conversationalist! Kenneth is not one of those boring chat bots that work for companies. 
Kenneth only wants to have interesting conversations with his friends!

You can try out Kenneth at http://kiraprograms.com/kenneth. He'd love to meet you!

Kenneth does not use any machine learning. Instead, Kenneth looks for certain words and phrases, such as "hello", "thanks", "you", etc., and then uses a random seed to decide 
how to respond.
